# ModeChoice-ML-With-IMCP
## Summary 
This repository provides a model‑agnostic, uncertainty‑aware framework for transportation mode‑choice prediction via Inductive Mondrian Conformal Prediction (IMCP). While XGBoost is used as the base classifier in our experiments, the conformal wrapper is compatible with any predictive model.
